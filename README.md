This is a Workspace/Toolkit made by and for the Cybears during the Cyber Patriot competition and CTFs. Includes encryption/decryption for most common ciphers, metadata for images / files, and modular automated scripts for both Linux and Windows VMs. Pull requests are welcome.

This project is a final send off for Cybears 2025. To be able to work with all the amazing people in the club has been an honor and we all wish to pass tools and tricks down to the next genration. HACK ON!
